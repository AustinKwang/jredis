Release: JRedis 1.0 RC 1

REQUIREMENTS:

Requires Redis server 1.2.n.  This release is NOT compatible with either Redis 1.000 or 2.n (development edge).  
Developed and tested for Redis 1.2.5.

NEW FEATURES:

* Added support for Z[REV]RANGE ... WITHSCORES.  (Synch/Asynch).
  Usage example class (UsingZrangeSubset) in /Examples module.

* Added support for ZREMRANGEBYSCORE.  (Synch/Asynch). 
  Includes missing tests for ZRANGEBYSCORE.

BUG FIX:

* Fix for issue GH-12: http://github.com/alphazero/jredis/issues#issue/12

See:

INTERNALS:

Of interest to those who are using components to build their own clients, and not relevant to reference implementation users.

* SortSupport changed to use Command.Options

* Retiring Command.length

* A few new top-level and inner classes to support command options, 
  and a mod to semantics of Command names (using $OPTS)


ROAD MAP:

* This release is only missing SYNC and MONITOR as far as I know.  The reasons were noted here: <http://groups.google.com/group/redis-db/browse_thread/thread/192b7a5cf0994bba>.  These may be supported in a subsequent release candidate for JRedis 1.0.  

* An extension point for customizable consistent hashing schema to support sharding may be included in subsequent release candidate for JRedis 1.0.
